# Async External Link Checking Implementation

## üöÄ Overview

We've implemented a **chunked async approach** for external link checking that solves the blocking issues you experienced. This keeps using `advertools` while making it non-blocking and domain-collision-safe.

## üîß How It Works

### **1. Domain-Aware Chunking**
```python
# URLs are intelligently grouped to prevent domain collisions
chunk_urls_by_domain(urls, max_chunk_size=20)
```

**Example:**
```
Input URLs:
- https://example.com/page1
- https://example.com/page2  
- https://google.com/search
- https://github.com/repo

Output Chunks:
- Chunk 0: [example.com/page1, google.com/search]
- Chunk 1: [example.com/page2, github.com/repo]
```

### **2. Async Processing with ThreadPoolExecutor**
```python
# Each chunk runs in separate thread to avoid blocking
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
    result = await loop.run_in_executor(executor, run_advertools_chunk, urls, output_file)
```

### **3. Intelligent Domain Settings**
```python
# Conservative settings for single domain (prevent blocking)
single_domain = {
    'DOWNLOAD_DELAY': 2,
    'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN': 1
}

# Aggressive settings for multiple domains
multi_domain = {
    'DOWNLOAD_DELAY': 1,
    'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN': 2
}
```

### **4. Timeout Protection**
- **Per chunk**: 5 minutes maximum
- **Overall process**: 10 minutes maximum
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial results if some chunks fail

## üìä Performance Improvements

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Blocking** | Blocks entire worker | Non-blocking |
| **Domain Collision** | High risk | Mitigated |
| **Timeout** | None (infinite) | Multiple levels |
| **Concurrent Audits** | 1 at a time | Multiple parallel |
| **Error Recovery** | Manual | Automatic partial results |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Provided

### **1. Test Script**
```bash
# Test the chunking logic
python test_async_external_links.py

# Test with real HTTP requests  
python test_async_external_links.py --live-test
```

### **2. Recovery Script**
```bash
# Check for stuck audits
python recover_stuck_audits.py

# Show all recent audit status
python recover_stuck_audits.py status

# Auto-recover all stuck audits
python recover_stuck_audits.py auto-recover

# Recover specific audit
python recover_stuck_audits.py recover 39
```

## üîç Key Features

### **Domain Collision Prevention**
- URLs from same domain distributed across different chunks
- Domain-specific rate limiting prevents server blocks
- Conservative settings for problematic domains

### **Fault Tolerance**
- Individual chunk failures don't stop entire process
- Partial results better than no results
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### **Resource Management**
- Maximum 3 concurrent chunks (configurable)
- Memory-efficient processing
- Automatic file cleanup

### **Monitoring & Logging**
```
Processing 47 external links in 5 chunks for audit_id: 39
Processing chunk 0 with 10 URLs for audit_id: 39
Processing chunk 1 with 8 URLs for audit_id: 39
External link checking completed for audit_id: 39 in 45.23 seconds
External link summary for audit_id 39: 4/5 chunks successful, 38 URLs processed
```

## ‚ö° Immediate Benefits

1. **No More Blocking**: Other audits can run while external links are checked
2. **Faster Recovery**: Stuck audits can be automatically recovered
3. **Better Reliability**: Timeouts prevent infinite hanging
4. **Domain Safety**: Intelligent chunking prevents rate limiting
5. **Partial Results**: Get some results even if some chunks fail

## üîß Configuration Options

You can tune these parameters in the code:

```python
# In check_external_links_async()
MAX_EXTERNAL_LINKS = 100        # Maximum URLs to check
max_chunk_size = 20             # URLs per chunk
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(3) # Max concurrent chunks

# Per-chunk timeout
timeout=300  # 5 minutes

# Overall timeout  
timeout=600  # 10 minutes
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run recovery script to fix stuck audits
2. **Testing**: Test the new implementation with small audits first
3. **Monitoring**: Watch logs to see performance improvements
4. **Tuning**: Adjust chunk sizes and timeouts based on your needs

## üè≠ Industry Alignment

This approach aligns with how major SEO tools handle external link checking:

- **Screaming Frog**: Uses chunked processing with domain limits
- **Ahrefs**: Separate service for external link analysis  
- **SEMrush**: Intelligent sampling and async processing

Your system now follows these same patterns while keeping the familiar `advertools` interface.

## üìû Usage

The new system is **drop-in compatible** - no API changes needed. Just deploy and the external link checking will be much faster and won't block other audits.

Your stuck Vercel and Google audits should be easily recoverable with:

```bash
python recover_stuck_audits.py auto-recover
```
